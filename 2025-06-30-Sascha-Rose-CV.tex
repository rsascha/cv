scalable, robust, and maintainable systems.

\vspace{1em}

I’m experienced in quality assurance for long-term projects — covering unit,
integration and end-to-end testing. I also focus on security-related aspects
and their seamless automation and integration into daily development and CI/CD
pipelines.

With a strong focus on continuous learning, and innovation, I stay up to date
with current tech trends and best practices.
