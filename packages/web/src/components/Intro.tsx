      <h2>What I Bring to the Table</h2>
      <p>
        I am a generalist — IT expert and full-stack developer with 20+ years of experience in software development,
        architecture, and IT operations. I specialize in modern web, app, server and cloud technologies — designing
        scalable, robust, and maintainable systems.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I'm experienced in quality assurance for long-term projects — covering unit, integration and end-to-end testing.
        I also focus on security-related aspects and their seamless automation and integration into daily development
        and CI/CD pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        With a strong focus on continuous learning and innovation, I stay up-to-date with current tech trends and best
        practices.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        My experience working with interdisciplinary teams allows me to communicate technical decisions effectively and
        lead implementations with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I'm skilled at bridging the gap between developers and management — translating technical challenges into
        business-relevant language and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>German (native), English (fluent)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
      <p>
        Seeking opportunities in web, app, and backend development either independently or together with trusted
        colleagues from actyvyst. Also open to permanent roles or full-time employment.
