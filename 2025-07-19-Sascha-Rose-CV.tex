    % What I Bring to the Table
    \section*{What I Bring to the Table}

    I am a generalist — IT expert and full-stack developer with 20+ years of 
    experience in software development, architecture, and IT operations.
    I specialize in modern web, app, server and cloud technologies — designing
    scalable, robust, and maintainable systems.

    \vspace{1em}

    I’m experienced in quality assurance for long-term projects — covering unit,
    integration and end-to-end testing. I also focus on security-related aspects
    and their seamless automation and integration into daily development and CI/CD
    pipelines.

    \vspace{1em}

    With a strong focus on continuous learning, and innovation, I stay up to date
    with current tech trends and best practices.

    \vspace{1em}

    My experience working with interdisciplinary teams allows me to communicate
    technical decisions effectively and lead implementations with confidence.

    \vspace{1em}

    I’m skilled at bridging the gap between developers and management — translating
    technical challenges into business-relevant language and vice versa.
